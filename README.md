## Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Folium
- Dash
- Plotly

## Libraries
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Folium: For interactive maps.
- Dash and Plotly: For creating dashboards and interactive charts.

## Key Contributions
1. Analyzed and visualized the change in average estimated fire area over time.
2. Explored the distribution of mean estimated fire brightness across regions.
3. Developed a dashboard using Dash and Plotly to display charts based on selected region and year.
4. Integrated Folium to mark the seven regions affected by wildfires on the Map of Australia.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data Analysis and Visualization
- Dashboard Creation with Dash and Plotly
- Geographic Visualization using Folium
- Collaborative Coding with Python and Pandas

## Achievements
- Identified peak periods of wildfire activities between 2010 to 2013.
- Provided insights into the distribution of mean estimated fire brightness and count of pixels across regions.
- Developed an interactive dashboard to facilitate user-driven exploration of wildfire data.

## Why this Repository
This repository showcases my skills in data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation using Python. It serves as a demonstration of my ability to work with geospatial data and provide meaningful insights. The inclusion of interactive maps and dashboards enhances the user experience and understanding of the wildfire dataset.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebooks for detailed code implementations and visualizations.
